;;;; Workflow and Convenience Tools

;; ido-mode allows you to more easily navigate choices. For example,
;; when you want to switch buffers, ido presents you with a list
;; of buffers in the the mini-buffer. As you start to type a buffer's
;; name, ido will narrow down the list of buffers to match the text
;; you've typed in
;; http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings
(ido-mode t)

;; This allows partial matches, e.g. "tl" will match "Tyrion Lannister"
(setq ido-enable-flex-matching t)

;; Turn this behavior off because it's annoying
(setq ido-use-filename-at-point nil)

;; Don't try to match file across all "work" directories; only match files
;; in the current directory displayed in the minibuffer
(setq ido-auto-merge-work-directories-length -1)

;; Includes buffer names of recently open files, even if they're not
;; open now
(setq ido-use-virtual-buffers t)

;; This enables ido in all contexts where it could be useful, not just
;; for selecting buffer and file names
(ido-ubiquitous-mode 1)

;; Enhances M-x to allow easier execution of commands. Provides
;; a filterable list of possible commands in the minibuffer
;; http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Smex
(setq smex-save-file (concat user-emacs-directory ".smex-items"))
(smex-initialize)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-x") 'smex)

;;;; Projectile Config

;; projectile everywhere!
(require 'helm-projectile)
(projectile-global-mode)
(setq projectile-completion-system 'helm)
(helm-projectile-on)

;; When switching projects, show buffers not files.
(setq projectile-switch-project-action 'projectile-switch-to-buffer)
