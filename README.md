# Development Environment Setup Repository

Run `setup.sh` to populate user specific dotfiles and emacs config
files. `setup.sh` expects a git username and email via `-u` and `-e`
command line options. `setup.sh` makes a symbolic link for each
dotfile (file or directory) listed in `$DOTFILES` of `setup.sh`:

```
$HOME/.path/to/dir-or-file -> dotfiles/.path/to/dir-or-file
```

It also symlinks the `elisp` directory to `$HOME/local/share/elisp`.

Because all files and directories are symlinked to this version
controlled repo, you can can use git at any time to update, save or
revert changes to your development environment.

`.gitconfig` is handled separately to avoid user specific git config
being accidentally used by others. This file is not symlinked, but
generated by the username and email provided to `setup.sh`
